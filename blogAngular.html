          Angular: When i hear this word in my mind i visualize a mature human
          being who has seen it all and knows the correct way of doing it and
          does things in his own ways. Well that is what angular is all about ,a
          <b> component based opinionated Frontend Framewrok</b> built by google
          , currently on its 13th version. What i have seen until now is Angular
          web apps are usuallly written in TypeScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          TypeSccript is said as a super set of Javascript meaning all things
          that are done via typeScript can be done via javaScript ,infact when
          we build an angular application the typeSript is actually converted
          into javaScript. Angular has a high learning curve as it has its own
          ways of doing things such as routing. Although typescript is a lot
          younger than JS but has high learning curve. Now when you combine it
          wiht Angular the learning curve obviously multiplies and hence is
          comparatively harder than it competitors react and vue .
        </p>
        <p>
          But Angular is not going anywhere, throughout years it has created its
          own huge community and Niche. Angular is loved by Big Enterprise
          companies and large teams precisely because of all the features it has
          to offer such as Strict Typing and no need to download any package or
          library to do things Angular itself is a huge ecosystem and has
          everything to offer you without usign any external library
        </p>

        <p>
          So Thats it..!! After stummbling upon every react vs Angular video in
          past few years this is what i learned about angular.I will cover React
          in my next blog.. So until next time take care ðŸ’—
