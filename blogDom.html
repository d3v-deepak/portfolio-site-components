          Each and every element we see on the website is at its core is an
          object containing a key and value pair just like a javascript
          object.Every html page is considered as a document and when we combine
          these two things we get a document where every element is comverted to
          a object by browser which has key and values.This is called as
          Document Object Modelling or DOM
        </p>

          Liking all posts on website, acccepting all friend request at once
          ,filling all the texbox with text and click a button without actually
          clicking it by just calling click() method in javaScript ,do testing
          and much more by just writing few lines in browser console. DOM
          unlocks a bunch of superpowers for developers
        </p>
        <h3>How do we get it done</h3>
